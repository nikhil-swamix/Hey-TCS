# Hey-TCS

hi ajit if you are reading this, i want to let you know, due to family issues, and general perception of Freelancing is risky, i have now decided and mentally fixed to work in corporate environment. im not able to work at full potential given the work from home nature , and focus on too many things. i have realized i need to work in a team environment to multiply the output.

if you can make any arrangements, given the "not very formal" nature of contractor work. and bonus marks in the fitness tests, it would be really helpful.
